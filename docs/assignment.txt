Assignment form
Your UI should be able to collect at least:
1. Topic of the assignment / story
Key takeaway / message
Additional context / background (free text)
Optional fields (include at least two):
target audience (demographic + locale)
creator values
creator niches (e.g., lifestyle/finance/etc.)
tone/style
You can add fields or merge them if you believe they improve matching or usability.

Outputs:
Results view must include:
For each of the top 3 creators:
Creator summary (name + key profile info; include avatar if available)
Why they’re a match (brief, human-readable; 1–3 sentences)
Suggested framing for a post (personalized to the creator, not generic talking points)

The suggested framing should clearly reflect:
the client’s goal and key takeaway
the creator’s style/audience/niches/values and the way in which they could fit the assignment

AI usage (intentionally open-ended):
Use AI where you think it adds value (e.g., framing generation, match explanations, re-ranking, query understanding). You may use any provider/model you choose.
