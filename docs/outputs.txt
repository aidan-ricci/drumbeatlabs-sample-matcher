What we’re evaluating:
We’re looking for strong signals in these areas:
Product & UX thinking (primary)
Clear, intuitive flow (someone unfamiliar can use it)
Good defaults, labels, and layout
Thoughtful states (loading, empty, errors)
Results presentation that helps a user make a decision
Engineering judgment
Pragmatic scope choices within reasonable time period
Clean structure and readability
Reasonable tradeoffs (speed vs correctness vs extensibility)
Matching approach
A defensible method for selecting the best 3, especially in cases where the perfect match doesn’t necessarily exist
Clear reasoning about what signals matter and why
AI integration quality
Outputs are tailored and useful (not generic)
Prompting/guardrails show good judgment
You can explain how you’d harden it for production, and where in your judgement it doesn’t make sense to use AI
